# Project

Agent OS is one personal-agent product. This `Andromeda` repository owns
the implementation; `agents` is the only operator/runtime CLI and
`/Users/user/.agents` is the personal installation's only state root.

`packages/core` contains the consolidated manager, contracts, harness, gateway,
inference, and bundled plugin domains. Other package directories and `data/`
are Git submodules. Their names identify packages, not alternate Agent OS
products or state authorities.

Historical product names, provider-home paths, launchers, and variables are
recovery evidence only. Do not add aliases, bridges, forwarding shims, or
fallback loaders.

Branch policy: active implementation uses a feature branch and a PR into `dev`.
Release synchronization then propagates the tested `dev` tip to `main` through a
dedicated `dev` to `main` PR; feature work never targets `main` directly. A narrowly
scoped `pull_request_target` review-infrastructure bootstrap may target `main` only when
GitHub can load the fix solely from the default branch. The PR must state that reason,
pass the existing default-branch gate, and be reconciled into `dev` and the next release.
