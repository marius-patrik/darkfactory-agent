# darkfactory-templates

Bun and TypeScript templates monorepo for DarkFactory-managed repositories.

This repository publishes the canonical starter templates used by DarkFactory. Each template is a standalone repository that can also be consumed independently. The monorepo ties them together with shared validation, sync scripts, and release conventions.

## Monorepo layout

### Workspace packages

- `packages/cli` – command-line package template (`@template/cli`).
- `packages/web` – web package template served by Bun (`@template/web`).

### Template submodules

- `templates/template-cli` – Bun CLI application template.
- `templates/template-web` – Bun web application template.
- `templates/template-bot` – TypeScript GitHub App bot template.
- `templates/template-repo` – generic Bun repository template.

Each submodule points to its own repository under `marius-patrik` and is tracked at the `main` branch.

## Setup

```powershell
bun install
bun run sync:submodules
bun run typecheck
bun run build
```

Run package scripts from the root:

```powershell
bun run dev:cli
bun run dev:web
```

## Validation

Root CI runs:

```powershell
bun run ci
```

This executes `bun run typecheck && bun run build` across all workspace packages. Submodule validation is run inside each submodule repository.

## Sync

To pull the latest submodule commits:

```powershell
bun run sync:submodules
```

To bump submodule gitlinks after a submodule release, open a dedicated bump PR against `dev`. Routine documentation-only changes should not mix in submodule gitlink bumps, but a coordinated refresh (such as updating root docs and pinning templates to their refreshed commits) may combine both in one PR.

## Release and enforcement model

- The `main` branch is the stable, release-ready state.
- The `dev` branch collects approved changes before they are promoted to `main`.
- All changes land through pull requests targeting `dev`.
- DarkFactory-managed files (under `.darkfactory/`, `.agents/.global/`, and repository policy files) are updated by automated tooling or explicit governance PRs. Manual edits should keep their structure intact.
- `.github/` workflows and `AGENTS.md` are part of the managed scaffold; update them through the normal PR process.

## DarkFactory-managed files

- `.agents/.global/` contains reusable agent operating rules. Keep these files intact when creating a new repository from a template.
- `.agents/.project/` contains project-specific facts, commands, decisions, status, and handoff context. Replace these files with the new repository's own context after using a template.

See each template's README for setup, scripts, expected customization steps, validation, and release notes.
