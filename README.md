# OKF Knowledge Agent

An LLM-managed knowledge base following the [Open Knowledge Format (OKF) v0.1 spec](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md) — a bundle of plain markdown files with YAML frontmatter, readable by humans, diffable in git, managed by an agent.

**Three ways in, one agent:**

- **MCP server** — `memory_query` / `memory_add` / `memory_update` / `memory_status` / `memory_maintain` tools over stdio or streamable HTTP. Each call drives an internal LLM agent with the OKF spec in its system prompt.
- **Web UI** — browse the bundle (tree, concept viewer, update log, conformance badge), see the memory as an Obsidian-style **force-directed graph** (drag/pan/zoom, colored by type, sized by connections, orphans ringed red, click to open), and chat with the same agent to test it. Tool calls render inline so you can watch it work.
- **Query-path replay** — every agent run (query/mutation/chat) records its traversal (searches → reads → writes) as a compact notation, persisted under `<bundle>/.traces/`. The graph view lists recent runs; selecting one replays the path as numbered directed hops over the graph — visited concepts ringed, search hits dotted, everything else faded.
- **CLI** — `pnpm agent:query "..."` / `pnpm agent:mutate "..."` smoke entries.

**Design rule: conformance is enforced in code, not prompts.** The deterministic bundle layer validates frontmatter (`type` required), regenerates `index.md` files, appends `log.md` entries (newest-first, spec §7), and sandboxes all paths to the bundle root. The LLM decides *what* to change; the code guarantees the result is a conformant bundle.

## Stack

pnpm monorepo:

| Package | What |
|---|---|
| `packages/core` | OKF bundle layer (zero LLM) + agent (Vercel AI SDK tool loop: search/read/list/write/patch/delete) + provider registry |
| `packages/server` | Fastify: MCP streamable-HTTP at `/mcp`, stdio bin, REST browse API at `/api/*`, streaming chat at `/api/chat`, serves the web build |
| `packages/web` | Vite + React + TS + Tailwind: bundle browser + agent chat (`useChat`) |

Providers (env-selected, swappable per chat): **Anthropic** (default), **OpenRouter**, **llamacpp** (llama.cpp `llama-server` / llama-swap — model auto-discovered from `/v1/models`, loaded model preferred), **local** (any other OpenAI-compatible endpoint).

### llama.cpp

```bash
# on the inference box — --jinja enables OpenAI-style tool calling
llama-server -m model.gguf --jinja --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

# here — no model id needed, it's discovered
LLM_PROVIDER=llamacpp LLAMACPP_BASE_URL=http://inference-box:8080 \
BUNDLE_ROOT=./sample-bundle node packages/server/dist/index.js
```

Works behind llama-swap too: discovery prefers the currently **loaded** model so a query doesn't trigger a multi-minute model swap. Pin a specific model with `LLM_MODEL=`.

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
cp .env.example .env   # add your API key

BUNDLE_ROOT=./sample-bundle ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... node packages/server/dist/index.js
# → http://localhost:3800  (web UI + /api + /mcp)
```

Dev mode (server on :3800, Vite HMR on :5180 with proxy):

```bash
BUNDLE_ROOT=./sample-bundle pnpm --filter @okf-agent/server dev
pnpm --filter @okf-agent/web dev
```

## MCP registration (Claude Code / Desktop)

```bash
claude mcp add okf-kb \
  -e BUNDLE_ROOT=/path/to/your/bundle \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... \
  -- node /path/to/okf-agent/packages/server/dist/mcp/stdio.js
```

Or point an HTTP MCP client at `http://host:3800/mcp`.

### Seed memory

A client LLM that only sees four bare tool names never gets the instinct to check memory. So at **session start** the server injects a compact overview of what the knowledge base contains (directories, concepts with types + descriptions, recent activity) through both channels that reach the model:

1. the MCP initialize **`instructions`** field (clients like Claude put it in the system prompt), and
2. the **`memory_query` tool description** — the universal fallback every tool-calling client loads.

The seed regenerates fresh for every new session. After `memory_add` / `memory_update` in a long-lived (stdio) session, the tool description refreshes via `tools/list_changed`, so the session sees its own writes. Out-of-band edits (hand edits, other clients) are picked up on the next session.

### Graph health & maintenance

Memory is a graph, not a pile of notes, and graphs rot: concepts go **orphaned** (nothing links to them) and links go **broken**. Two mechanisms keep it healthy:

- **Write-time linking** — new knowledge either enriches the concept it belongs to (an attribute of an existing entity is patched in, not filed separately) or, when it's a distinct entity, is created *and* back-linked from related concepts. Contradictions are superseded in place, never left standing alongside the old value.
- **`memory_maintain`** — a deterministic lint (orphans + broken links, surfaced in `memory_status` under `graph`) drives an internal agent to wire orphans into related concepts and fix dangling links. Run it periodically to counter drift; it's a no-op when the graph is already healthy.

This design mirrors the pattern in Karpathy's [LLM Wiki](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) (index.md + log.md, create-vs-enrich, lint for orphans). Deferred from that pattern until scale warrants: an explicit page-type schema, and hybrid FTS5+embedding search (the naive scan in `search.ts` is fine into the low thousands of concepts).

## Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
# bundle is a volume mount — point ./sample-bundle at any OKF bundle
```

## Tests

```bash
pnpm test                                  # core: 15 tests (spec §5/§6/§7/§9, sandbox, search, concurrency)
pnpm --filter @okf-agent/server exec tsx scripts/mcp-smoke.mts   # MCP stdio round-trip (needs SMOKE_BUNDLE + an API key)
```

## Environment

See [.env.example](.env.example). `BUNDLE_ROOT` is required; `GIT_AUTOCOMMIT=true` commits every mutation.
