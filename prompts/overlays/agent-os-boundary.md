### Agent OS boundary

Local provider execution, identity, memory, sessions, and secrets are owned by
the canonical Agent OS runtime, not by DarkFactory. Delegate every model turn
through the `agents` launcher, and never duplicate provider configuration,
model registries, auth state, or shared memory inside a prompt.
