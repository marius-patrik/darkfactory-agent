# src-root PRD

> This file is the **source of truth** for src-root. The backlog, branches, PRs, and releases are derived from it. Edits to this file are the primary way to steer the product.

## Vision

Define the product vision here, aligned with the agents-mono root product context.

## Core loops

- **L1 Sync**: Managed baseline files pushed to every installed repo.
- **L2 Review**: Review gate on every PR.
- **L3 Work**: Ready issues become branches, PRs, and merged code.
- **L4 Planning**: PRD.md edits automatically reconcile sequenced backlog issues.

## Milestones

- **M1 — Scaffold**: Establish this PRD and initial backlog via DarkFactory L4 planning.

## Non-goals

- Multi-tenant / marketplace distribution.
- A separate web dashboard — GitHub Projects/issues are the dashboard.

## Operating rules

- Issue = contract; acceptance criteria in the issue body are the definition of done.
- Never force-push, never bypass gates, never merge red.
