# Public plugin platform

`agent.package.json` schema version 2 is Andromeda's single public extension
contract. The machine-readable schema is published from
`src/sdk/agent-package.schema.json`; the SDK parser is the authoritative
normalization and validation boundary. The published schema is exercised with
a strict Draft 2020-12 validator; semantic checks use the maintained semver and
SPDX expression parsers instead of permissive string patterns.

Every v2 manifest declares:

- publisher, package id, semantic version, SPDX license, and supported
  Andromeda/API versions;
- one declarative or digest-pinned WASI runtime;
- agent, command, TUI, web, server, and model contributions;
- explicit workspace, session, memory, model, network, secret, clipboard,
  notification, and external-URL permissions.

Native executable and script entries are not part of schema v2. Installation
also validates the observed artifact digest, every referenced JSON descriptor,
and the declared WASI module and digest before canonical state changes.

Commands are registered once through `src/commands`. Third-party commands use
`<publisher>/<plugin>:<command>` names by default. A manifest may request one
top-level alias, but the registry exposes it only when the corresponding
`<publisher>/<plugin>:<alias>` grant is present. Collisions fail atomically,
and plugins cannot shadow the embedded `help`, `version`, `doctor`, or
`plugins` recovery commands. Installation reserves requested alias tokens
before a grant exists, so two packages cannot publish mutually incompatible
claims and race for the same future grant.

Version 1 manifests remain readable only for internal legacy packages while
their runtimes are folded into Andromeda. The installer has one path-pinned,
first-party bridge for importing the repository's bundled legacy skills and
records that bridge in provenance. Every public capability kind, including
skills, requires version 2. The installer verifies the declared Andromeda
compatibility range against the authoritative product version and preflights
the candidate together with every installed v2 command contribution before
publishing state. This is a migration boundary, not a second public format.
Direct `packages register` mutation is disabled: public packages must enter
through the installer so artifact admission and registry publication remain
one serialized transaction. Doctor, package execution, and harness execution
admit `packages.json` only when every record exactly matches a canonical
checksum-verified install, target, artifact store object, manifest, and
collision-free command set. External and legacy-native registry entries fail
closed before execution.

Canonical public identity is always `<publisher>/<id>`. State and registries
retain that identity verbatim; physical capability directories use a
contained, filesystem-safe encoding so equal package ids from different
publishers coexist on every supported platform.

The initial distribution surface is direct local/Git installation. Signing,
grant persistence, activation, rollback UI, WASI execution, and sandboxed web
bridging build on the normalized descriptor and are intentionally outside this
foundation.
