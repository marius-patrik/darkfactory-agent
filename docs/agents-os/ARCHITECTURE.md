# Agent OS Container Architecture

Status: target contract. The repository has lifecycle planning code, but no
released Agent OS image or root Dockerfile. Commands must not report an image
build, pull, deployment, or environment switch as complete unless the real
container boundary was invoked and verified.

## Product boundary

Agent OS remains one product inside or outside a container:

- `agents-manager` owns state discovery, provider pinning, sessions, memory,
  capabilities, package registries, and lifecycle commands.
- `packages/core` contains manager, harness, contracts, gateway, inference, and
  bundled plugin domains; those are components, not separate products.
- `packages/darkfactory` is a GitHub control-plane package, not a second agent
  brain.
- `packages/life-support`, `packages/skyblock-agent`, and
  `packages/singularity` are managed packages.
- `data/agent-os/` is the sole managed data checkout, never an alternate Agent OS state root.

The container is replaceable compute. It must mount the one authoritative
`AGENTS_HOME`; it must never seed or maintain another writable identity,
memory, provider, session, or capability authority.

## Image contract

A future image must:

1. use a pinned Linux base and pinned Bun, Node.js, Python/uv, and Go versions;
2. run as a non-root user under a real init/supervisor;
3. install the `agents-manager` source or release artifact as `agents`;
4. contain reproducible package code only, with no credential or mutable user
   state baked into a layer;
5. declare health checks for every enabled service;
6. record source commit, build time, channel, version, and immutable digest;
7. pass `agents state doctor` against a disposable mounted state root.

Expected references are `agents-os:<version>` locally and
`ghcr.io/marius-patrik/agents-os:<version>` when a publication workflow exists.
Moving tags such as `dev` are discovery channels, never provenance.

## Runtime contract

The MVP may supervise manager, harness, inference, gateway, and DarkFactory
processes in one container. Each process receives the same canonical root
projection and a package-declared data/workspace scope. Splitting services into
multiple containers later must not change state authority.

Required rules:

- provider homes remain `AGENTS_HOME/clis/<provider>`;
- raw provider databases, models, caches, logs, and locks are local-only;
- secret names/scopes may appear in plans, but values never do;
- mounted source/data/workspaces use absolute host paths;
- container removal never removes mounted data without a separate explicit
  prune decision;
- no lifecycle operation follows a symlinked state root.

## Lifecycle surface

The declared command family is:

```text
agents os doctor [--json]
agents os image list [--json]
agents os image build|pull ... [--dry-run]
agents os create|start|stop|status|logs|exec|terminal|remove ...
agents os deploy <profile> ... [--dry-run]
```

Dry-run output is a plan, not evidence. A non-dry-run command must verify
Docker availability, the exact image/digest, mounts, environment, container
labels, and health before recording success. Until the missing image build and
release artifacts exist, unsupported mutations fail explicitly.

Managed containers use labels in the `io.agents.os.*` namespace and default to
no automatic restart for local development. The TUI is a view over this same
command/state surface; it cannot maintain a separate registry.

See [Data Contracts](DATA-CONTRACTS.md) for mounts and
[Build and Release](BUILD.md) for the current implementation gate.
